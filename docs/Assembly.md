# Assembly

Obviously, the best place to start with with the official [E3D ToolChanger Assembly Guides](https://e3d-online.dozuki.com/c/ToolChanger_and_Motion_System_Assembly_Guides).

However, there are some things that are handy to know about ahead of time, before reading through the entire build guide. 

## Required Tools and Consumables

You will need the following tools to complete the build. This is mentioned at the very beginning of the official docs, just referencing here for completeness.

- 5mm, 4mm, 2.5mm & 2mm allen keys
- M2.5 and M3 thread taps
- 12mm box wrench
- Knife
- Set/Machinist's Square
- Mallet


There are a few things that will be required for assembly that do not come with the ToolChanger / Motion System kit:

- Blue Loctite
- Super Glue
- PTFE Grease

## Printed Components

You will need to print a handful of required components before starting the build. For all stock components (from the official [E3D Github](https://github.com/e3donline)) be sure to follow the instructions in the README file for number of each to print along with recommended print settings.

### Tool Heads

- [Stock Bowden Tool STLS](https://github.com/e3donline/ToolChanger/tree/master/V6%20Tool/STLs) - These files are refereced both in [section 3](https://e3d-online.dozuki.com/Guide/03+-+V6+Bowden+Tool+Assembly./103?lang=en) and [section 5](https://e3d-online.dozuki.com/Guide/05+-+V6+Bowden+Tool+&+Dock+Installation./109?lang=en) of the build guide. 
    - **NOTE:** _As of Nov 8, 2020, the standard V6 tool seems to include Winsinn fans and, as such, you will need to print the Winsinn version of the V6 PCF fan duct. The Volcano tool, however, comes with the older fan type and there is only one type of Volcano PCF fan duct. It is recommended you check which fan type you have before printing the fan ducts._
