For all stock components (from the official E3D Github ) be sure to follow the instructions in the README file for number of each to print along with recommended print settings. Tool Heads Stock Bowden Tool STLS - These files are refereced both in section 3 and section 5 of the build guide. NOTE: As of Nov 8, 2020, the standard V6 tool seems to include Winsinn fans and, as such, you will need to print the Winsinn version of the V6 PCF fan duct. The Volcano tool, however, comes with the older fan type and there is only one type of Volcano PCF fan duct. It is recommended you check which fan type you have before printing the fan ducts.
